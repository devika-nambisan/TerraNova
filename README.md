TerraNova is a hackathon project built at HackTx to simplify responsible waste disposal. Our goal is to make sustainability effortless and rewarding.
It uses in-browser Machine Learning to identify an item and provide accurate disposal instructions instantly. 


Core Features:
 - ML Classification: Uses MobileNet (TensorFlow.js) to classify photographed items into six core categories: Plastic, Glass, Paper, Metal, Compostable, or E-Waste.
 - Localized Guidance: Provides specific instructions for disposal and helps users find nearby recycling/hazardous drop-off centers via an interactive Leaflet.js map.
 - Gamified Habit: Rewards correct disposal with "stars" that grow a user's personal "Galaxy," encouraging repeatable positive environmental actions.
 - 100% Frontend: Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, making it fast, portable, and easy to run in any browser.
