# 🌎 TerraNova — Scan. Sort. Save Earth! 🌟

TerraNova is a fun hackathon project built at **HackTx** to make responsible waste disposal **easy, rewarding, and even a little magical**. ✨  
It uses **in-browser Machine Learning** to identify an item and instantly tell you how to dispose of it the right way. ♻️

---

## 🌟 Core Features
- **🧠 ML Classification:** Uses MobileNet (TensorFlow.js) to identify items as Plastic, Glass, Paper, Metal, Compostable, or E-Waste.  
- **📍 Localized Guidance:** Shows exactly how to dispose of your items and helps you find nearby recycling or hazardous drop-off centers on a cute, interactive **Leaflet.js map**.  
- **🌌 Gamified Habit:** Earn stars 🌟 for correct disposal and watch your **Galaxy grow**, making recycling fun and motivating!  
- **💻 100% Frontend:** Built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — runs fast in any browser, no downloads needed.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/devika-nambisan/TerraNova.git
2. Open the file `terranova-app-final3.html` in your browser and start saving the planet! 🌍

## 💡 Inspiration
Every day, millions of people want to do the right thing for the planet — to recycle, compost, or properly dispose of waste — but it’s not always obvious where things go. 😅  
**TerraNova** was born to fix that!  
_"TerraNova"_ means **“New Earth,”** and our mission is to make eco-friendly choices **as simple as snapping a photo**, helping everyone take small actions that add up to big environmental wins. 🌱

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Snap a photo of an item with your device camera 📸  
2. MobileNet (TensorFlow.js) analyzes it right in your browser 🧠  
3. The item gets sorted into one of six categories ♻️  
4. Instructions pop up instantly ✅  
5. Check nearby recycling/hazardous sites on the interactive map 🗺️  
6. Dispose correctly and **earn stars for your Galaxy**! 🌟

## ⚙️ Tech & Implementation
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** MobileNet via TensorFlow.js  
- **Camera Access:** `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`  
- **Map:** Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap tiles  
- **Gamification:** Star counter & particle animations saved in `localStorage`  
- **Privacy:** 100% client-side, no data sent anywhere 👀  

---

## 🛠 Challenges
- Making sure the ML model accurately recognizes different items 🧐  
- Getting the star animation to scale nicely 🌌  
- Handling camera permissions across all browsers 🔒  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Built a **working prototype in under 24 hours** ⏱️  
- Designed a **clean, intuitive interface** for instant recycling guidance 🖥️  
- Created a **fun, gamified experience** that motivates daily eco-friendly habits 🎮  

---

## 🌈 Future Plans
- Expand the **AI recognition database** for more items 🥤🍌🛢️  
- Add **streaks, badges, and leaderboards** for extra motivation 🏅  
- Social features to **share eco-achievements** with friends 👯‍♀️  
- Partner with schools, cities, and recycling programs 🏫🌆  
- Track and visualize **cumulative environmental impact** over time 📊
